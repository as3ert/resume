Proceedings Volume 12941, International Conference on Algorithms, High Performance Computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AHPCAI 2023); 1294114 (2023) https://doi.org/10.1117/12.3011553

## Research

`Jun. 2023 - Jul. 2023`
__Algorithms for Game Design__

`Remote`
Leader of a 3-person group; Supervised by Prof. Bill Nace from Carnegie Mellon University

Utilized Python to develop a hybrid of two uniform maze generation algorithms, Aldous-Broder and Wilson, and locate the best usage ratio through experimentation
Generated mazes of different sizes using Aldous-Broder and Wilson and recorded the execution times 
Calculated the optimal usage ratio by alternating between the two algorithms at critical running phases 
Demonstrated that the performance was better compared to either algorithm by itself when the percentage of visited cells reaches a specific value
Tested the algorithmic ratio on generating larger mazes and tried other maze generation algorithm
